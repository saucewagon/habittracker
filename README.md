To run:
- cd /project
- npm start
- go to http://localhost:3000/

This project was built using node.js, express, mongoDB, and handlebars. This was my first foray into learning how all of the elements of a web application join together. I really enjoyed how easy it is to do certain things in comparison to the .NET world of C# and C++.

Special thanks to codaffection for getting me started with this project.
